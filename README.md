A CLI and Go API that add useful functions on top of Hashicorp Vault.

Please read the [godoc documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/Lingrino/vaku/vaku)
for all API usage information and examples.

Please use `vaku help` in your terminal for all documentation and usage information
regarding the Vaku CLI

**CLI Improvements:**

**Running Tests:**

Tests are meant to be run side by side with a real Vault server docker image. This
creates an external dependency for the tests but makes it much simpler to test different
Vault versions and key/value mounts. With docker and docker-compose installed tests
can be run with a simple `make test`. CircleCI will also build all commits and report
status on all PRs.
