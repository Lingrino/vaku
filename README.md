**Running Tests:**

Tests are meant to be run side by side with a real Vault server docker image. This
creates an external dependency for the tests but makes it much simpler to test different
Vault versions and key/value mounts. With docker and docker-compose installed tests
can be run with a simple `make test`. CircleCI will also build all commits and report
status on all PRs.
