Vaku is a CLI and API for running path- and folder-based operations on the Vault Key/Value secrets engine. Vaku extends the existing Vault CLI and API by allowing you to run the same path-based list/read/write/delete functions on folders as well. Vaku also lets you search, copy, and move both secrets and folders.
