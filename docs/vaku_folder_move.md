## vaku folder move

Move a vault folder from one location to another

### Synopsis

Takes in a source path and target path and moves every path in the source to the target.
Note that this will move the input path if it is a secret and all paths under the input path that
result from calling 'vaku folder list' on that path. Also note that this will overwrite any existing
keys at the target paths. Note that this deletes (not destroys) the source folder after a successful copy.

Example:
  vaku folder move secret/foo secret/bar

```
vaku folder move [source folder] [target path] [flags]
```
