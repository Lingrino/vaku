## vaku folder delete

Recursively delete an entire vault folder

### Synopsis

on every path found in the folder, and for v2 secret mounts that means deleting the active version, but not all versions.
Use 'vaku folder destroy' for removing all versions from v2 mounts

Example:
  vaku folder delete secret/foo

```
vaku folder delete [path] [flags]
```

### Options

  -h, --help   help for delete
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
