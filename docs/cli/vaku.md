## vaku

Vaku is a CLI for working with large Vault k/v secret engines

### Synopsis

Vaku is a CLI for working with large Vault k/v secret engines

The Vaku CLI provides path and folder based commands that work on
both version 1 and version 2 k/v secret engines. Vaku can help manage
large amounts of vault data by updating secrets in place, moving
paths or folders, searching secrets, and more.

Vaku is not a replacement for the Vault CLI and requires that you
already are authenticated to Vault before running any commands. Vaku
commands should not be run on non-k/v engines.
